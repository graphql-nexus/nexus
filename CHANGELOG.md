# Changelog

### 0.12.0 final (unreleased)

### 0.12.0-rc.5

- feat: Add `customPrintSchemaFn` to makeSchema config

### 0.12.0-rc.4

- refactor: Remove NEXUS_SHOULD_GENERATE_ARTIFACTS env var

- feat: Add `shouldExitAfterGenerateArtifacts`

- Warn on missing `outputs` in `makeSchema` config

- Type-level `defaultResolver` has been removed, similar functionality can be achieved with the `onCreateFieldResolver` plugin API

### 0.12.0-rc.2, rc.3

- fix: bug in nullability check plugin

### 0.12.0-rc

- feat(deps): Bumps the default minimum version of graphql-js to 14.5.0

  Nexus uses the new [`extensions` property](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2097) on types to store metadata provided to Nexus types, in order to make them usable by plugins.

- feat: Adds "Plugins" API, [see the docs](docs/api-plugins.md) for more info on what all these can help accomplish

- feat(plugin): Add `nullabilityGuardPlugin`. See [the docs](docs/plugin-nullabilityGuard.md) for more info

- feat(plugin): Add `fieldAuthorizePlugin`. See [the docs](docs/plugin-fieldAuthorize.md) for more info

  This is the same behavior as before, but implemented more flexibly as a plugin. This will be
  automatically added if no plugins are specified, otherwise it will need to be imported & added
  to `makeSchema`.

- feat(schema): Adds `shouldExitAfterGenerateArtifacts` option to `makeSchema`

  The `shouldExitAfterGenerateArtifacts` makes it possible to exit after the types are generated,
  useful if you do not check a schema artifact into source control, but wish to generate before the code runs.

- refactor: Removes `nexusWrappedType`

  This was an internal implementation detail which should not affect end users

- refactor: Removes `t.modifyType` API

  This may not have ever worked, it was only intended to modify fields on an `objectType` which were
  originally implemented by an interface. Please open an issue if this is a breaking change for you, so we
  can understand the use-case and design a better API.

- test: Improved code coverage, adds base threshold to new PRs

#### beta.14

- feat(plugins): onInstall hook (#236)
- feat(deps): add support for TypeScript 3.6 (#255)

#### beta.13

- fix(typegen): explicitly await removeFile before write (#254)

#### beta.12

- feat(config): <strike>env var for should-generate-artifacts (#244)

  You can now set the `shouldGenerateArtifacts` config option by env var
  `NEXUS_SHOULD_GENERATE_ARTIFACTS=true|false`.</strike> (removed, see 0.12 release notes)

- fix(typegen): delete prev file before writing next (#252)

  Before, sometimes, you would have to open the typegen file to make VSCode pick
  up its changed version. This change should reduce/remove the need for this
  workaround.

* feat: <strike>by default typegen as an @types package (#230)

  BREAKING CHANGE

  You should not have to configure typegen manually anymore. We
  generate by default into `node_modules/@types/nexus-typegen` which TypeScript
  will automatically pick up. If you use the `types` `tsc` compiler option
  however, make sure to include `nexus-typegen`.

  This is a breaking change because typegen is enabled even when config
  `outputs` have not been configured (before, they were required). The
  heuristics of `shouldGenerateArtifacts` remain unchanged.</strike> (removed, see 0.12 release notes)
