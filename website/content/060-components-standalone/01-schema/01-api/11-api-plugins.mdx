## Plugins

Nexus ships with a plugin API which allows you to define your own abstractions when building out a GraphQL schema. The plugin layer allow you to:

- Define new options for types and fields in a type-safe manner
- Layer runtime execution before and after a resolver
- Modify schema configuration
- Customize the emit behavior of TypeScript type generation (coming soon)

We also ship with several plugins out of the box, and will have more in the near future:

- [Connection Plugin](../plugins/connection)
- [Field Authorize Plugin](../plugins/field-authorize)
- [Nullability Guard Plugin](../plugins/nullability-guard)
- [Query Complexity Plugin](../plugins/query-complexity)

### Defining a sample plugin:

```ts
import { plugin } from '@nexus/schema'

export const myErrorGuardPlugin = plugin({
  name: 'MyErrorGuardPlugin',
  description: 'Catches errors and logs them to Sentry, ',
})
```

## Plugin Config:

### name

Every plugin is required to have a unique name identifying the plugin. This is used in error-messages
and warnings.

### description

A string describing the plugin. Currently not used for anything, but it could be used in the future to
automatically create documentation for the stack of plugins used in Nexus.

### onInstall(builder)

The "onInstall" hook is used as it sounds - it is invoked once before any of the types are processed for the schema. This hook is primarily useful in allowing a plugin to add "dynamics fields" to augment the API of the definition block.

```ts
plugin({
  name: 'onInstallExample',
  onInstall(builder) {},
})
```

The `builder` option provided has several properties, which allow you to influence the schema via the plugin.

### onBeforeBuild(builder)

The "onBeforeBuild" is called after all `onInstall`, but just before the schema is constructed.

```ts
plugin({
  name: 'onBeforeBuildExample',
  onBeforeBuild(builder) {},
})
```

### onAfterBuild(schema)

The "onAfterBuild" hook is provided the schema, and is useful to validate contract of the schema
with the expectations of the plugin. The [nullabilityGuard](../plugins/nullability-guard)

```ts
plugin({
  name: 'onAfterBuildExample',
  onAfterBuild(schema) {},
})
```

### onCreateFieldResolver(config)

Every ObjectType, whether they are defined via Nexus' `objectType` api, or elsewhere is given a resolver.
The [defaultFieldResolver](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/82a0c336de05b4ab0d24d5557b56135c828fe888/src/execution/execute.js#L1179-L1197) is provided if none is specified by the field definition.

When the resolver is created for a type, this can optionally return a "middleware" which wraps the resolve behavior of the field. Here's an example of writing a "LogMutationTimePlugin", which logs how long it takes a mutation to complete:

```ts
const LogMutationTimePlugin = plugin({
  name: 'LogMutationTimePlugin',
  onCreateFieldResolver(config) {
    if (config.parentTypeConfig.name !== 'Mutation') {
      return
    }
    return async (root, args, ctx, info, next) => {
      const startTimeMs = new Date().valueOf()
      const value = await next(root, args, ctx, info)
      const endTimeMs = new Date().valueOf()
      console.log(`Mutation ${info.operation.name} took ${endTimeMs - startTimeMs} ms`)
      return value
    }
  },
})
```

### onMissingType

The "onMissingType" hook occurs when a type is provided as a string, but was never explicitly defined.
This can be helpful in situations where you have boilerplate types which can be constructed
generically / programmatically based on their name.

Here is an example of a plugin which creates a "ResourceResponse" type whenever you see a string:

```ts
/**
 * Creates a ____ResourceResponse type
 *
 * type OrganizationResourceResponse {
 *   ok: Boolean!
 *   resource: Organization!
 *   query: Query!
 * }
 *
 * @param resource
 */
export function resourceResponse(resource: string) {
  return objectType({
    name: `${resource}ResourceResponse`,
    definition(t) {
      t.boolean('ok', () => true)
      t.field('resource', { type: resource as any })
      t.field('query', { type: 'Query', resolve: () => ({}) })
    },
  })
}

const ResourceTypePlugin = plugin({
  name: 'onMissingTypeExample',
  onMissingType(typeName, builder) {
    if (/(.*?)ResourceResponse/.test(typeName)) {
      return resourceResponse(typeName.slice(0, -16))
    }
    return null
  },
})
```
