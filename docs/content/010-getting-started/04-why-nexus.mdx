## Schema-First GraphQL APIs

There's a common path that most GraphQL API developers take when they get started: define a schema with the Schema Definition Language and write resolver logic to furnish data.

A simple schema might look like this:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]!
}
```

The corresponding resolver logic would then be supplied to allow the API to serve data:

```js
const Query = {
  posts: () => [
    {
      id: '1',
      title: 'My first GraphQL server',
      body: 'How I wrote my first GraphQL server',
    },
  ],
}
```

The schema type definitons, along with the resolvers, would then be passed to something like `ApolloServer` to create and serve the API.

This way of building a GraphQL server is often referred to as the "schema-first" approach. We start by defining the shape of our API and then write code to tell it how to return data.

While the schema-first approach is easy to get started with, it comes with some inherent drawbacks that can make development difficult when applications start getting bigger.

Nexus takes a different approach to building GraphQL servers. Instead of keeping a separate schema and set of resolvers, with Nexus we write _both_ our schema and resolvers in the same spot using code.

## The Code-First Approach

Writing a GraphQL server with Nexus differs starkly to the traditional schema-first approach. With Nexus, we write our schema and resolver logic all in one place with a common language (JavaScript/TypeScript).

Refactoring the `Post` example above to Nexus would look like this:

```ts
import { objectType, queryType, makeSchema } from '@nexus/schema'

const Post = objectType({
  name: 'Post',
  definition(t) {
    t.id('id')
    t.string('title')
    t.string('body')
  },
})

const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.list.field('posts', {
      resolve: () => [
        {
          id: '1',
          title: 'My first GraphQL server',
          body: 'How I wrote my first GraphQL server',
        },
      ],
    })
  },
})

const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [Post, Query],
})
```

The benefits of taking a code-first approach to GraphQL APIs isn't always apparent at first glance. However, the benefits are realized over time, especially as application and team size grows.

There are numerous benefits to taking a code-first approach with Nexus:

- [Schema and resolver co-location](#schema-and-resolver-co-location)
- [SDL and type generation](#automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation)
- [No need for extra tooling](#no-need-for-extra-tooling)

## Schema and Resolver Co-location

When building a schema-first GraphQL API, it is common to start out by placing all type definitions and resolvers in a single file. When both the schema and the resolvers live next to one another, it's fairly straightforward to work in both at the same time.

As the application grows, however, it is most often desired to move parts of the schema into their own separate modules and files. It's at this point that working on a GraphQL API becomes a bit more tedious. With this modularization comes the need to switch back and forth between the Schema Definition Language and JavaScript/TypeScript to write the resolvers. Not only does one need to constantly switch between files, they also need to do a context switch mentally to work between the two langauges.

With Nexus, our schema and its resolvers are always defined together. Nexus also allows us to write everything in a common language. This allows us to side-step the co-location/context switching issue altogether and helps us to be more productive, even as our applications grow to be quite large.

## Automatic Type and Schema Definition Language Generation

One major benefit of using Nexus is its ability to automatically generate TypeScript types and GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) files. The generated types are useful for adding extra type safety to the code used to power your GraphQL API. The generated SDL files can be used for many purposes. For example, we can configure our editors to know about the shape of our APIs to give us introspection for the queries and mutations we write.

Type and SDL generation comes for free with Nexus and can be enabled by supplying some configuration in the `makeSchema` call.

```ts
import path from 'path'

const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [Post, Query],
  outputs: {
    schema: path.join(__dirname, 'generated/schema.gen.graphql'),
    typegen: path.join(__dirname, 'generated/nexusTypes.gen.ts'),
  },
})
```

## No Need for Extra Tooling

When writing a schema-first GraphQL API, it's often necessary to install and configure several editor extentions and other extra tooling. This is because the Schema Definition Language needs to be properly understood by out editors to be useful.

Nexus offers the benefit of providing a great developer experience without the need for any extensions or extra tooling. It also doesn't require developers to learn the Schema Definition Language to be productive. This combination means that JavaScript/TypeScript developers can be added to a project and be successful faster.
