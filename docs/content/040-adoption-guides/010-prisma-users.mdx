## Hello Prisma User!

This guide is for you if you use @prisma/client on a project that does not use Nexus but are wondering if you should.

Nexus is a GraphQL schema library.

If you haven't already, you should read [Welcome to Nexus](/).

This guide will show you the ways you can use Nexus with the Prisma toolkit.

## Vanilla integration

As a Prisma user you can easily integrate Prisma into Nexus yourself, take a look at the [with-prisma example](https://todo.com)

## Plugin!

Vanilla works, but there's something better. The Nexus Prisma _plugin_ (`nexus-plugin-prisma`). It levels up your experience, including:

- Declarative APIs for projecting types from your Prisma schema onto your GraphQL Schema
- Declarative APIs for creating mutations and queries (including automatically implemented resolvers!)

For more info checkout the [Prisma plugin documentation](/pluginss/prisma).

## Learning Path

1. Read [Welcome to Nexus](/)
2. Do [The Nexus Tutorial](/getting-started/tutorial/chapter-introduction)
3. If using the Prisma plugin (you should!) read [Welcome to Nexus Prisma](/pluginss/prisma)
