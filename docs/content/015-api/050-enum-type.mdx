## enumType

[GraphQL Docs for Enum Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types)

Defining as an array of enum values:

```ts
const Episode = enumType({
  name: 'Episode',
  members: ['NEWHOPE', 'EMPIRE', 'JEDI'],
  description: 'The first Star Wars episodes released',
})
```

As an object, with a simple mapping of enum values to internal values:

```ts
const Episode = enumType({
  name: 'Episode',
  members: {
    NEWHOPE: 4,
    EMPIRE: 5,
    JEDI: 6,
  },
})
```
