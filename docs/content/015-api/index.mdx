title: API

## Overview

The API has been carefully designed with the following goals in mind:

1. Type safety by default
1. Readability
1. Developer ergonomics
1. Playing nicely with Prettier formatting

The API has evolved over the last few months of early development and internal use, and outside of implementing [additional features](../../../meta/spec-sheet#future-features) is unlikely to undergo major structural changes.

That is, before you open a GitHub issue or pull-request with a suggested change to the API, ensure that it meets all four of those criteria listed above and be able to explain why a change is necessary.

Each public API is documented. Find them in the sidebar.
