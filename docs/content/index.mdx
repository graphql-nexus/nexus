## Welcome!

Robust, composable type definition for GraphQL in TypeScript/JavaScript.

<blockquote class="warn">
<b>Note:</b>

The documentation is very new and may contain some gaps, please help us fill them in by opening issues or better yet, pull-requests when you think something could be explained better. The [examples](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/schema/tree/develop/examples) are a great place to look to better understand how the library can be used.

</blockquote>

GraphQL Nexus aims to combine the simplicity and ease of development of SDL development approaches like [graphql-tools](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema.html) with the long-term maintainability of programmatic construction, as seen in [graphene-python](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/), [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby), or [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).

Nexus builds upon the primitives of `graphql-js`, and attempts to take the simplicity of the SDL schema-first approach and pair it with the power of having the full language runtime at your disposal.

GraphQL Nexus was designed with TypeScript/JavaScript intellisense in mind, and combines TypeScript generics, conditional types, and type merging to provide full auto-generated type coverage out of the box.

Check out the [example projects](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/schema/tree/develop/examples) to get some ideas of what this looks like in practice, or try it out in the [playground](/playground) to see what we mean!

## Installation

```sh
npm add nexus
npm add graphql # required as a peer dependency
```

## Building an Example Schema

As documented in the [API reference](/api/introduction) GraphQL Nexus provides a consistent, scalable approach to defining GraphQL types in code.

```js
import {
  objectType,
  interfaceType,
  queryType,
  stringArg,
  enumType,
  intArg,
  arg,
  makeSchema,
} from "@nexus/schema";

const Node = interfaceType({
  name: "Node",
  definition(t) {
    t.id("id", { description: "Unique identifier for the resource" });
    t.resolveType(() => null);
  },
});

const Account = objectType({
  name: "Account",
  definition(t) {
    t.implements(Node); // or t.implements("Node")
    t.string("username");
    t.string("email");
  },
});

const StatusEnum = enumType({
  name: "StatusEnum",
  members: ["ACTIVE", "DISABLED"],
});

const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.field("account", {
      type: Account, // or "Account"
      args: {
        name: stringArg(),
        status: arg({ type: "StatusEnum" }),
      },
    });
    t.list.field("accountsById", {
      type: Account, // or "Account"
      args: {
        ids: intArg({ list: true }),
      },
    });
  },
});

// Recursively traverses the value passed to types looking for
// any valid Nexus or graphql-js objects to add to the schema,
// so you can be pretty flexible with how you import types here.
const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [Account, Node, Query, StatusEnum],
  // or types: { Account, Node, Query }
  // or types: [Account, [Node], { Query }]
});
```

## Resolving: Inline Function

One common idiom in GraphQL is exposing fields that mask or rename the property name on the backing object. GraphQL Nexus makes this simple by allowing a function as the second parameter to any built-in scalar resolver function.

```ts
const User = objectType({
  name: "User",
  definition(t) {
    t.id("id", (o) => o.user_id);
    t.string("name", (o) => o.user_name);
    t.string("description", (o) => o.user_description);
  },
});
```

## Auto-Generated Artifacts

When you make a change to your GraphQL schema it is useful to see how exactly this changes the contract of the API, or the associated typings.

GraphQL Nexus takes care of this for you, simply provide a path to where you want these files to be output and it will auto-generate them when the server starts. By default, this only occurs when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`.

```js
const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [
    /* All schema types provided here */
  ],
  outputs: {
    schema: path.join(__dirname, "../../my-schema.graphql"),
    typegen: path.join(__dirname, "../../my-generated-types.d.ts"),
  },
});
```

Although your `.graphql` file is generated, we recommend you check the file into source control. This gives you visibility into how changes in type construction affect the schema consumed by the end-user.
